Unsolved problems include:

• Password from doesnt give feedback, or clear when switching pages

Planning:

I decided to model my project after a music forum community, because I love music and thought it would be cool to have a communal app for sharing your library with friends. I knew this would also give me the chance to create a many to many relationship between users and music. I wanted there to a be a 1 – 5 rating system that users could rate albums with, and then based upon those scores, a chart could rank the top albums.  This was one of my stretch goals which unfortunately I did not fulfill. It was more difficult than I expected to make simple queries, so something involving math seemed out of reach for the span of the project. However I was able to create personal library along with community album collections, complete with rating entries.
